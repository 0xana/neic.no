We are happy to announce an [open call for course mobility proposals](/training/course-mobility). NeICâ€™s [Ratatosk](/ratatosk) mobility enhancement programme is a framework for transferring courses, extend and/or supplement national training efforts (even across national borders) in a Nordic context. The application process for the first round is available from September 15, 2017 to *October 15, 2017*.

The main target group are presenters (teachers, trainers and instructors) who want to open up their courses to a Nordic audience.
