## Mobility Enhancement cut-off dates

The application process is stalled for the time being. For the current, we have spent the budget, due to succesfull candidates. For the next round, feel free to check out this page occasionally as we will update the budget after mid Summer.

### Course Mobility
This is an announcement for  [open call for course mobility proposals](/training/course-mobility). NeICâ€™s [Ratatosk](/ratatosk) mobility enhancement programme is a framework for transferring courses, extend and/or supplement national training efforts (even across national borders) in a Nordic context.

The main target group are presenters (teachers, trainers and instructors) who want to open up their courses to a Nordic audience.

### Travel Grants
You can now apply for a [travel grant](/training/travel-grant) offered by the NeIC [Ratatosk](/ratatosk) Mobility Enhancement Programme - the grant will provide or supply travel funding for staff and end users (researchers) of the Nordic e-infrastructure community who can benefit from access to training programs offered in other Nordic countries.
