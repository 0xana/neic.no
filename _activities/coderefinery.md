The goal of this Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration project is to provide
researchers with infrastructure and training in the necessary tools and
techniques to create sustainable, modular, reusable, and reproducible software.

The result of this project is a set of software development e-infrastructure
solutions, coupled with necessary technical expertise and extensive training and
on-boarding activities, training material and best practices guides which
together form a Nordic platform for research groups and institutes to develop a
better collaboration on software and thereby to catalyze reproducible research
and collaboration.
