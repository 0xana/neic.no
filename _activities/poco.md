Pool competencies is a focus area under the NeIC 2016-2020 strategy. The pool
competencies working group is working to map out the competencies that are
present or needed among the Nordic e-infrastructure providers and key stakeholders,
starting within the area of training and currently expanding to other areas
starting with data management.
