The NeIC EISCAT_3D Technical support EISCAT_3D community on network, computing
and storage challenges.

EISCAT_3D is an environmental research infrastructure on the European ESFRI
roadmap. It is proposed as an international research infrastructure using the
incoherent scatter technique to study the upper atmosphere above the Arctic in
order to investigate how the Earth's atmosphere is coupled to space. EISCAT_3D
is a multi-static phased array radar system that will be installed at remote
locations in the most Northern parts of the Scandinavian peninsula. The system
will be operated by and be an integral part of the EISCAT Scientific
Association.

The e-infrastructure challenges for EISCAT_3D include finding cost-efficient
state of the art solutions for on-site computing and establishing network
connections between the different sites and with the data archive. The goal of
the NeIC "Supporting EISCAT_3D" (E3DS) project is to support the preparation of
the implementation of EISCAT_3D for those aspects concerning e-infrastructure.
Particular goals also include to develop solutions for locating the data archive
within existing national e-infrastructures and to support EISCAT in planning the
recruitment of e-science experts.
