Today, data saves lives. With more and better data, we can save more lives. By
pooling and sharing sensitive personal data for biomedical research between
countries, we can save more lives faster, making better cures, better diagnosis
tools, and better decision support for policy makers.

Tryggve2 is about developing state-of-the-art scalable infrastructure for safe,
efficient, ethical, and legal storage, analysis and sharing of sensitive
personal data for biomedical research between countries. The project supports
open and transparent data access processes by engaging with the key stakeholders
from each of the Nordic countries. It will contribute to facilitating automated
cross-border sample and data movements complying with the Nordic legal
framework, with an ambition to scale to Europe and beyond.
