NeIC is carrying out a project analysis exercise in 2017q2, for quality
assurance and continuous improvement of NeIC as an organization.

### Process
* Base work on PPS project analysis materials, and adapt to NeIC needs for
  projects and operations.
* Do it openly (eg Google drive folder open for comments by all).
* Do it as a matter of course. Do not wait until there is a problem.
* Questionnaires and interviews with activity leads and owners.
* Open invitation for spontaneous feedback from anyone involved in activities.
* Document proposed actions to be followed up at later date.

Compressed time frame:

* PPS recommends to have "2 or more experience project leads" doing project review.
* Workaround: Develop materials in collaboration with a few pilots, get feedback
  from PPS training, then the rest.
