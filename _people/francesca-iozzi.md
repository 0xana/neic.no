Maria Francesca Iozzi, PhD in Computational Chemistry. I am group leader of the
research service group aiming at developing, deployng and operating services
designed to fulfill IT-requirements in research. We are working in close
collaboration with NorStore and we are also partner of several European and
National Projects. Strong focus is on the development of portals for high
performance computing, based on Galaxy tool but strongly customised to meet the
needs of different researching areas and completely integrate with our HPC
facilities. I am leading the operation of the TSD (Service for Sensitive Data)
developed and deployed at USIT/UiO. TSD is a platform that allow storing,
computing analysing and sharing of sensitive research data in compliance with
the norwegian law.
