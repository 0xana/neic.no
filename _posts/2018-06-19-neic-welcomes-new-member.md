NeIC welcomes a new member to the board
===========================

**NeIC is pleased to announce that Hans A. Eide (Sigma2) will be the Norwegian representative on the NeIC board from June 2018.** 

Hans has a background as researcher in remote sensing and holds a PhD in atmospheric physics from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks.
Prior to his nearly 11 years stay in the US, Hans studied at the University of Bergen where he obtained a MSc in physical optics. In his 
research, Hans worked extensively with advanced model codes for radiative transfer, combined with collection and analysis of various sensor
data, both ground- and space-based. Relocating back to Norway in 2006, Hans followed his interest in High Performance Computing (HPC) and
took up a position at USIT, the central IT-department at the University of Oslo (UiO). He became group leader of the HPC group at USIT in 
2009, and in 2012 took on the position as head of the Department of Research Computing. During his time at USIT, Hans was instrumental in
evolving IT for research at UiO, from mostly HPC oriented services, to a strategic and mission critical area offering services and support
to a wide range of research. In 2015, Hans relocated back to his hometown of Stavanger, and at the same time joined Uninett Sigma2, the 
Norwegian national e-infrastructure provider, as a special adviser. At Sigma2 he is mainly working on advanced user support, national and
international collaboration, strategy, technology and architecture.

Hans will take over the responsibilities from Gunnar Bøe, Director of Sigma2. NeIC would like to thank Gunnar Bøe for all his efforts as
chair member of the NeIC board.
