All Hands Meeting 2018
===============================

**Last week saw the completion of another successful AHM meeting for NeIC.**

The NeIC All Hands Meeting 2018 came to an end last week and we would like to thank all our participants for making this years’ event even more successful than the previous. Not only did Skeikampen present us with winter wonderland surroundings – we also had a record number of participants with 68 altogether. 

The programme included talks and groups sessions that concerned cross-disciplinary issues of eInfrastructure, as well as opening the debate around NeICs strategy and internal areas of improvement. The event also contained a great deal of cooperation and group work between the participants, making it an excellent platform for networking with NeIC co-workers. 

In between session plenty of time was set aside for exploring Skeikampens skiing opportunities, both downhill and cross-country. With the hotels spa access, pub quiz at the bar and NeIC-waffle breaks, the stay allowed for relaxation and socialising.

We hope all the participants enjoyed the full AHM experience and we hope to see you all at next years’ event as well!
