NICEST ESGF workshop at NSC
===========================

**The [National Supercomputer Centre (NSC)](https://nsc.liu.se/) in Link√∂ping hosted an [ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov/) node administrator workshop organized by the [NICEST](/nicest/) project from 22 through 24th May, with the aim to impart hands-on training in ESGF installation, certificate management, and datanode configuration for data publication.**

The participants were a mix of both data scientists and system administrators. External speakers, Wyser Klaus of SMHI, Sweden, Ingo Bethke, of Uni Research, Norway,  and Ag Stephens of CEDA, UK, delivered presentations on [experiences with the ece2cmor3 tool](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1weVn-D5wc3UUdVE8dtb_Bze5iMps_1-n), [processing NorESM output](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zthUO_Yflrp3op6m378_ZklfMUpuWydJ) for [CMIP5](https://cmip.llnl.gov/cmip5/) and [CMIP6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6), and [re-thinking compliance checking](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GCKTn2B9-l9SIqNy5xpmZOMtlt0LcrJf), respectively.

The participants used a specially setup [virtual testbed](http://esg-dn2.nsc.liu.se/virtualtestbed/checklist.pdf), to practice setting up ESGF services; these resources will be available to them, even after the workshop, to be able to get more hands-on experience, prior to setting up production installations. It was decided to try and coordinate monthly telephone conferences, to exchange notes on progress, and discuss issues if any.
