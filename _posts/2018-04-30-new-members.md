Two new members joining the NeIC Executive Team
===============================

__During May this year we will welcome two new members to the NeIC Executive Team, increasing our capacity in the areas of 
eScience, strategy and funding.__

Our new Executive Manager Lene Krøl Andersen will work to stimulate the use of eScience tools. This includes engagement with research communities, gathering of requirements, exploitation of future opportunities, facilitation of meetings and collaboration spaces. She will also contribute to the establishment of a Nordic arena for open science as well as contributing to implementation of NeIC’s strategy and to future strategy development.

Our new Senior Adviser, Johanna Törnroos, will be working on ensuring long-term funding. She will also work on identification and evaluation of impacts of NeIC, strategy development, strategy implementation and strategy evaluation. Her position will  increase the resilience of the Executive Team in regards of day-to-day coordination of NeIC activities.

We would like to take this opportunity to welcome Johanna and Lene to NeIC, and look very much forward to having them onboard.
