A way back in: the CERN Post-Career Break Fellowship Programme
===========================

**Have you taken time out for personal reasons from your career in science or engineering? Would you be interested in returning to a scientific career if you could? Application are now open for the CERN Post-Career Break Fellowship Programme!"**

Since 2014, CERN has offered a professional opportunity for keen scientific or engineering talent with a common experience: a temporary 
absence from the field. The way we see it:

**_You were taking off..._**

You were in the early days of a profession in science or engineering, or perhaps already steeped in and building up expertise. You were in
and were making it, contributing to your field with passion. But then...

**_You had to take some time..._**

Perhaps you started a family, perhaps someone in your family needed looking after. Either way, a personal situation called upon you with 
responsibilities, and for the time being, you had to step aside. But now...

**_Your're ready to take a leap again!_**

Your situation has evolved, we hope for the best! You're considering returning, more likely you never quite stopped thinking about it. But
the way back is a steep climb and we at CERN know that. 

That's why we've developed [an opportunity](https://jobs.smartrecruiters.com/CERN/743999669719198-post-career-break-fellowship-programme?trid=3320305b-0f5f-4245-a3a4-e2e46bc46590) to help you on your way. 

*Applications close 3rd of September*

COMPANY DESCRIPTION 
At CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, physicists and engineers are probing the fundamental structure of the universe. 
Using the world's largest and most complex scientific instruments, they study the basic constituents of matter - fundamental particles that
are made to collide together at close to the speed of light. The process gives physicists clues about how particles interact, and provides
insights into the fundamental laws of nature. Find out more on http://home.cern.

*Diversity has been an integral part of CERN's mission since its foundation and is an established value of the Organization.*
