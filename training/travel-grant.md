## Ratatosk Mobility Enhancement Travel Grant

Open call for travel grants 
The Ratatosk Nordic mobility enhancement programme efforts are directed to increasing the opportunities for trainees in two ways:

You can now apply for a travel grant offered by the NeIC Ratatosk Travel Mobility Enhancement Programme - the grant will provide or supply travel funding for staff and end users (researchers) of the Nordic e-infrastructure community who can benefit from access to training programs offered in other Nordic countries. The application process is available from September 15, 2017 to October 15, 2017.

Furthermore, we are happy to announce an open call for course mobility proposals. NeICâ€™s Ratatosk mobility enhancement programme is a framework for transferring courses, extend and/or supplement national training efforts (even across national borders) in a Nordic context. The application process is available from September 15, 2017 to October 15, 2017.
The main target group (course mobility) are presenters (teachers, trainers and instructors) who want to open up their courses to a Nordic audience.
