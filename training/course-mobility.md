## Open call for course mobility proposals

### Purpose
The goal of training is to raise competence in staff and end users which leads to more effective and productive work by the staff and end users. The benefits include more efficient operations and use of resources and an improved capability for the researchers in conducting research.
 
NeIC's interest in training is focused on e-Science and e-Infrastructure skills among scientists and e-Infrastructure personnel in the Nordic region, for the purpose of raising the quality of the scientific output. Also continuously improvement of courses will be secured through regular evaluations, for the benefit of the studentsâ€™ competences and for faculty to choose the best learning abilities.



### Approach
The Ratatosk Nordic mobility enhancement programme efforts are directed to increasing the opportunities for trainees in two ways:

First is the student mobility part (travel grants) enabling trainees to travel to attend Nordic training courses which are not available locally.  

The second, the course mobility part of the programme, is by supporting training courses as movable modules that can bring the training closer to the trainees.
 
This open call for proposals focuses on the course mobility part of the programme. The goal is to bring the courses closer to the participants by contributing to the creation of transferable courses, or updating existing courses and making them more transferable.
