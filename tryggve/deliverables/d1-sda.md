## Tryggve D1 - Sensitive Data Archiving

This deliverable of the Tryggve2 project aims at establishing a code-base that can be used to establish secure archives for sensitive data, both as part of a federated [EGA](https://ega-archive.org), and as free-standing archives. We also aim to establish such archives in the partner countries.



Feel free to [contact the Tryggve project](mailto:tryggve@neic.no) on any questions concerning the activities regarding Sensitive Data Archiving and Local EGA.
