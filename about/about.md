## About NeIC

**The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC)  facilitates development and
operation of high-quality e-Infrastructure solutions in areas of joint Nordic
interest. NeIC is a distributed organisation consisting of technical experts
from academic high-performance computing centres across the Nordic countries.**

The collaboration was launched in 2003 in response to a decision by the research
funding agencies in the Nordic countries to contribute to a distributed
computing infrastructure for analysing and storing the data generated by
experiments at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/large-hadron-collider)
at [CERN](http://home.web.cern.ch/) (the European Organization for Nuclear
Research, physicists and engineers).

New, innovative services can be developed and deployed by bringing together the
competencies of all the Nordic e-Infrastructure providers, and challenging this
pool of highly skilled IT experts with the needs of the Nordic user communities.
This is precisely what NeIC aims to do in key areas of common Nordic
interest. By combining the expertise already found in the Nordic region, we can
provide leverage for more efficient and responsive e-Infrastructure, thereby
avoiding  costly duplication of work in each individual country. An important
focus of NeIC in the coming years will be on innovation in new e-Infrastructure
solutions, in addition to selected services such as the Nordic Tier-1 service
for the WLCG community.

NeIC was established as an organisational unit under
[NordForsk](http://www.nordforsk.org/en) in Oslo on 1 January 2012.
